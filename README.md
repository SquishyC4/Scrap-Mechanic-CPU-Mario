# Mario in Scrap Mechanic
This is a project attempting to make a CPU and 'GPU' type device capable of playing [Mario level 1-1](https://www.bing.com/search?q=mario+1-1) in [Scrap Mechanic](https://www.bing.com/search?q=scrap+mechanic)  in real time using only logic gates ( and a few qol mods to help )

# Note
**Mario Main** is using an old old cpus assembly and will be re-written for the current cpus assembly soon (ish)
